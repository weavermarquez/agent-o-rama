# Agent-o-rama Examples

This directory contains example implementations of AI agents using Agent-o-rama.

Here's an example of running an agent from this directory:

```
./run-example com.rpl.agent.react.ReActExample
```

This will prompt for an input to the agent and then print the result. It also opens the UI at http://localhost:1974, which will remain open for viewing traces, performing more invokes, and other exploration until you press enter in the terminal.
